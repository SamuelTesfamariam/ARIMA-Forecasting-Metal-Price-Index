# Abstract: 
  Given the importance of metal to world economy, governments, corporations, and individual investors, it is vital that their future movements are predicted and managed. One way of forecasting metal prices at a global level is to use global data. One such series is the "PMETAINDEXM" (Federal Reserve Economic Data - FRED) for the Global Price of Metal Index (base metals). Using a time series model ARIMA (p,d,q), this paper adequately estimates and makes a 6 moth ahead forecast of the series. The Box-Jinkins method is used to identify, estimate, evaluate, and forecast the time series.
